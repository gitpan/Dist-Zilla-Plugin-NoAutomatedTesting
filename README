NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoAutomatedTesting - Avoid running under CPAN
    Testers

SYNOPSIS
      # In dist.ini - It is important that NoAutomatedTesting follows MakeMaker

      [MakeMaker]
      [NoAutomatedTesting]

    The resultant distribution will exit at "Makefile.PL" if the
    "AUTOMATED_TESTING" environment variable is set, indicating a CPAN
    Tester environment.

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN Testers are great and do a worthy and thankless job, testing all
    the distributions uploaded to CPAN. But sometimes we don't want a
    distribution to be tested by these gallant individuals.

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoAutomatedTesting is a Dist::Zilla plugin that
    mungles "Makefile.PL" to detect that it is being run by a CPAN Tester
    and "exit 0" if it is.

    As this plugin mungles the "Makefile.PL" it is imperative that it is
    specified in "dist.ini" AFTER "[MakeMaker]".

  METHODS
    These are required by the roles that this plugin uses.

    "setup_installer"
        Required by Dist::Zilla::Role::InstallTool.
